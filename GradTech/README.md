Project 3 - GradTech App

What it does:

GradTech is created in the spirit of Google Now, it is intended to be a sleek, highly integrated app that combines a recent graduate or young adult's interests; such as providing access to FaceBook, Twitter and MeetUp, as well as giving the user access to thier Google Calander, and a Note Pad. The goal for the app is to be a one-stop-shop for the user so they don't have to switch between many different apps to accomplish common important tasks.

Known bugs:

1) Some cards have scrolling enabled within them, and sometimes this functionality is hard to use. For example, the user may have to 'pinch' or 'zoom' on a list to get the app to focus on that list, then the user must keep one finder in place while the other one moves in order to activate the scrolling function.'
